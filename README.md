# MLS-STATS-APP

This is my latests project using the Streamlit framework. I created a dashboard showing various stats from Major League Soccer. I scraped the MLS Data from Sports-Reference.com to 
get the latest tables using beautifulsoup. I then used plotly express to create different visualizations 
showing both xG, Goal Difference, and Goals scored. I experimented with different libraries such as Seaborn, 
Matplotlib, and Plotly. These libraries have there own advantages and disadvantages and I've had most of my 
experience working with Matplotlib. In this case I decided to use Plotly as I found it to match overall the aesthetic of Streamlit.
Lastly Streamlit made it very easy for someone else to create their own visualizations 
combining different categories provided from the data. I used radio buttons where a user can choose between the 
Eastern and Western Conference and plot the different categories on an X and Y axis. You can see how some factors relate to others. I 
found this project to be extremely enjoyable as I was able to see in real time how my code change on Streamlit. I was also happy that 
there was a plethora of different documentation available whenever I got stuck. I'll defiantly be incorporating Streamlit in the future!
